Currently trying to figure out the best way to get .wav files from Spotify without violating ToS (cannot rip .wav files directly from Spotify).

Most promising library appears to be Savify which scrapes Spotify metadata, keeps the metadata, and uses it to convert the corresponding YouTube video of the song into any of several common audio file formats.
